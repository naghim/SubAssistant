## FAQ

<p align='justify'><b> ðŸ‘€ How to use SubAssistant?</b> </br>  Using SubAssistant is a piece of cake! Choose the action you wish to take from the side menuâ€”whether to comment out text or delete comments. Use the "Select File" button to open the .ass file. The program will automatically propose an output filename within the same folder. If you prefer a different folder or wish to rename the output, utilize the "Browse" button or directly edit the output path. Upon clicking the button, the selected operation will be executed.</p>

<p align='justify'><b> ðŸ‘€ Can SubAssistant mess up my subtitles?</b> </br> No, SubAssistant will always generate a new file with the modifications, does not do any editing in the input file, so your subtitles are safe!</p>

<p align='justify'><b> ðŸ‘€ Can SubAssistant handle <code>.srt</code> files?</b></br> No, currently SubAssistant does not support <code>.srt</code> files. </p>
